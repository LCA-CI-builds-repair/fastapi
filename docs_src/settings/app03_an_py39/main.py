from functools import lru_cache
### Summary of Changes:
1. Import `lru_cache` decorator to cache the results of the `get_settings` function.
2. Ensure that the correct import for `lru_cache` is included to resolve any import errors.
3. Verify the usage of the `Annotated` type from `typing_extensions` for the `settings` parameter.
4. Check for any missing dependencies or imports that may be required for the code to function correctly.
